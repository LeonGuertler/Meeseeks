Given the above observation, please provide a small number of actions in the following format:
[('key', 'home'), ('mouse', (x,y), 'Right'), etc.]

The available actions are:
- all keys on a standard keyboard (for special keys, use the name (i.e. 'backspace', 'enter', etc.))
- you can move the mouse using x,y coordinates (i.e. (100, 200)) and execute a click using 'Left' or 'Right'

Please note that the actions will be executed in the order they are provided. 

Here is an example of what you reply should look like.
